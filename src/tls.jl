Sets the task-local device and HIP stream.
If `device`, , or `stream` is `nothing` and an existing task-local state
has been configured, then those values are retrived from the existing state
(unless the `priority` has changed, in which case a new stream is selected);
if no task-local state has been configured, then defaults are used
when `nothing` is supplied.

Note that these are only task-local defaults; when a device or stream is
manually passed to an AMDGPU operation (such as `@roc`), then the task-local
value is ignored in favor of the passed argument.
