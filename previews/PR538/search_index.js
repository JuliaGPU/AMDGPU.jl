AMD GPUs have Compute Units (CUs), which can be thought of like CPU cores. Those CUs have (on pre-Navi architectures) 64 \"shader processors\", which are essentially the same as CPU SIMD lanes. The lanes in a CU operate in lockstep just like CPU SIMD lanes, and have execution masks and various kinds of SIMD instructions available. CUs execute wavefronts, which are pieces of work split off from a single kernel launch. A single CU can run one out of many wavefronts (one is chosen by the CU scheduler each cycle), which allows for very efficient parallel and concurrent execution on the device. Each wavefront runs independently of the other wavefronts, only stopping to synchronize with other wavefronts or terminate when specified by the program.","category":"page"},{"location":"execution_control/","page":"Execution Control","title":"Execution Control","text":"We can control wavefront execution through a variety of intrinsics provided by ROCm.
